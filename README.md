# Memory Game

Welcome to our Memory Game challenge! This is an application written with C#. We're excited to see how you can enhance it during the event.

## Challenge Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to build a memory game using GitHub Copilot in C# . The game is based on the classic card game where players need to match pairs of cards.

### Rules of the game

1. The game should have a grid of cards that are face down and randomly placed.
2. When a player clicks on a card, it should flip over to reveal the image on the other side.
3. The player should then click on another card to try to match the images.
4. If the images match, the cards should stay face up.
5. If the images do not match, the cards should flip back over.
6. The game ends when all pairs of cards have been matched.

The matching _images_ could also be numbers, words or symbols.

To complete this challenge, you will need to implement the game logic and user interface that includes the required features listed below. You can also add any additional features you think would enhance the game.

## Basic Requirements

The game should have the following required features:

- A grid of cards that are randomly placed and face down.
- The ability to flip over cards to reveal the image on the other side.
- Logic to check if the images on two cards match.
- A way to keep track of the number of moves made by the player.
- A way to keep track of the time taken to complete the game.
- A scoring system based on the number of moves and time taken; less moves and time should result in a higher score.
- A way to reset the game and start a new game.
- A way to display the player's score in previous games.

## Stretch Goals

Some additional features you could add to enhance the game:

- A timer to limit the time taken to complete the game.
- A way to select the difficulty level of the game (e.g., number of cards, time limit).
- A way to save the player's score and display a leaderboard.
- A way to customize the cards with different images or themes including different game board backgrounds.
- A way to add sound effects or animations to the game.
- A way to add hints or power-ups to help the player complete the game. For example a hint button that reveals the location of a couple of cards one of which is the correct match at the expense of some time or random cards that add to or subtract from the remaining time.
- A way to play the game with multiple players or against an AI opponent.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

To help you get started, we have provided a basic scafolding for the game. The repository contains all of the starter code. The pages directory contains the SplashScreen, GameScreen, and EndScreen pages and the Card component.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [DotNet Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing & Running

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/im-copilot-sandbox/csharp-webapi-memorygame.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd csharp-webapi-memorygame
```

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

```bash
code .
```

4. Reopen the project in the DevContainer

5. Start the server:

```bash
dotnet watch
```

## Using GitHub and GitHub Copilot

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control. You can learn more about how to use GitHub repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github).

[GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) is your AI pair programmer. With GitHub Copilot, you can write code faster with fewer errors.

## DotNet

This project is built with DotNet. If you're new to these technologies, here are some resources to get you started:
